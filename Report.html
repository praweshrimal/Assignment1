				<h5>Introduction</h5><br><br/>
				<p>
					I got experience of learning the basics of web development, coding, designing and debugging process as I was a fresher to this module. I came to this college with zero level knowledge of basics of computing, but I got opportunity to learn all the basics from starting level. At first, I was not able to write basic tags of HTML when I came to this college because in my educational background, I haven’t yet studied about all these module contents because I was from science(bio) faculty. Though I had many problems throughout the learning process I tried to learn many more things about it and once I have done my first web page done through all the HTML tags and coding, I was happy with my learning. This helps me to practice them wisely. Day by day I became familiar with coding and debugging process. Throughout my learning I got many problems where Mr. Ankit Thapa helped me to solve all the problems easily.</p><br>

					<h5>Observation</h5><br>
